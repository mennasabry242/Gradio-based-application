**1. Project Overview**

This is a unified interface built with Gradio that supports two primary tasks:

Generating image descriptions using a multimodal model (llava-1.5-7b-hf)
Generating Python code using a code generation model (deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct)
Users can choose to perform either task independently or both simultaneously.

**2. Setup Instructions**

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM
Python libraries: torch, transformers, gradio, Pillow

**3. Test Folder**

Include the test prompts and the expected answers generated by the code model.
