 1. Project Overview:
    This is a unified interface built with Gradio that supports two primary tasks: (1) generating image descriptions using a multimodal model (llava-1.5-7b-hf), and (2) generating Python code using a code generation model (deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct). Users can choose to perform either task independently or both simultaneously.
2. Setup Instructions:
   Prerequisites(Python 3.8+, CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM, torch, transformers, gradio, Pillow)
3. Test folder:
   Include the test and the answer of the code
